Use an auxillary stack in order to provide FIFO functionality using two stacks. 
Whenever a new element is to be pushed onto the "queue", first pop off all elements from the 
stack (stk) and push them the aux. Then push onto the empty stk the new element to be added in 
the "queue", so this new element will be the last element "dequeued" from pop() off the stack after 
the remaining items from aux and placed back onto stk on top of this new element.
